# 🌌 3D Three-Body Problem Simulation

This project simulates and visualises the motion of three gravitationally interacting bodies in 3D using Newtonian mechanics. The animation helps explore complex, often chaotic trajectories that arise from simple initial conditions.

> The above video shows bodies orbiting in 3D, with colored trails and wall projections to help visualise their motion.

## 🧠 Features

- Newtonian gravity-based simulation of 3 bodies
- 3D animation with rotating view
- Colour-coded trajectories with fading projections onto walls
- Dark theme and pastel colouring for visual clarity
- Automatically removes rigid-body drift (centre-of-mass motion)

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

---

## 🚀 Run the Simulation

```bash
python ThreeBody_Walls.py
```

If `ffmpeg` is available, it will export as an `.mp4`; otherwise it falls back to `.gif`.

---

## ✏️ Customization

To adjust the simulation:

- Change `masses`, `positions`, and `velocities` in the script
- Modify `colors` and background styling
- Tune simulation duration via `steps` and `dt`
- Adjust wall projection transparency or camera spin speed
